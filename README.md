A simple tool to extract the WPF styles for `FrameworkElement`s.

These can provide a useful starting point to your own customisations.

This repo derives from code source from [Eli Arbel](https://arbel.net/2006/11/05/revamped-style-snooper/),
though the original source may have been [Walt Tirscher](https://wpfwonderland.wordpress.com/2007/01/02/wpf-tools-stylesnooper/).
These various projects were hosted on blogs which have since yielded broken links to downloads and such.
Hopefully this repo lasts as long as WPF developers do.
